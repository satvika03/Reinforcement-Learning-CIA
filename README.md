CIA1: K-arm Bandit Based Solution for a Recommendation System:
The implementation of K-arm bandit approach to develop a recommendation system, optimizing the selection of items based on user interactions and feedback. It aims to balance exploration and exploitation to enhance user satisfaction and engagement.

CIA2: MDP-Based Reinforcement Learning in a Grid Environment
A 100x100 grid is created with obstacles placed between two random points. An MDP-based reinforcement learning agent is built to optimize both policies and actions at every state. The performance of the Dynamic Programming (DP) method is benchmarked against Q-learning and SARSA to evaluate their effectiveness in navigating the grid and reaching the goal.
